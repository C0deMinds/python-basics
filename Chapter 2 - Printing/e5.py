print("""
Once upon a time, on a remote island surrounded by misty waters, 
there was a legend of a hidden treasure. The island was said to 
hold secrets that no one had ever uncovered.

print("""
Adventurers from all over the world set out to find the treasure, 
drawn by the tales of its untold riches. However, none returned with success. 
The island's lush jungles and rugged cliffs kept its mysteries well-guarded.

print("""
One day, a young explorer named Alex arrived on the island. 
Armed with determination and a trusty map, Alex embarked on a journey 
that would challenge his wit and courage.
""")

print("""
As Alex delved deeper into the heart of the island, they encountered 
ancient ruins, strange creatures, and cryptic puzzles. 
Each step brought them closer to the truth behind the legend.
""")

print("""
In the end, it wasn't just about finding the treasure; 
it was about discovering the island's hidden history and the lessons it held. 
Alex realized that the real treasure was the knowledge gained through the adventure.

print("""
And so, the legend of the mysterious island continued, not as a tale of wealth, 
but as a story of discovery, bravery, and the magic that lies within the unknown.
